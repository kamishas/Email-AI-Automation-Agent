You: "Tuesday at 2pm?"
Them: "2pm doesn't work, how about 3pm?"
You: "3pm works! I'll send a calendar invite"
```

**AI Agent Way** (1 email):
```
AI: "Hi! I'd love to meet next week. 

Based on your calendar, here are my available times:
- Tuesday, Jan 7 at 10 AM, 2 PM, or 4 PM
- Wednesday, Jan 8 at 11 AM or 3 PM

Click your preferred time and I'll send a calendar invite:
[Book Tuesday 10 AM] [Book Tuesday 2 PM] [Book Tuesday 4 PM]
[Book Wednesday 11 AM] [Book Wednesday 3 PM]

Looking forward to it!"
```

**Result**: Meeting scheduled in 1 email instead of 5.
